    <p>I have used several semantic tags such as &lt;nav&gt; , &lt;footer&gt; &amp; &lt;header&gt; etc. <br>
      However , I have also used grid container to structure my website &amp; I prefer having this option. <br>
      I have used two main background colors which are dark red &amp; black for they match the background template.<br>
      I tried to combine the different coding solutions that I have learnt so far in every component of this website. <br>
      The design is pretty simple though with few colors and images. <br>
      The most challenging part in this website was the CSS since I have created different class attributes.<br>
      I think that include huge amount of skills and solutions that is difficult master within short time.<br>

  <div class="about">  <h2> <code> <b>The Website</b> </code> </h2> </div>

  <div class="p2" >
    <p>In order to build this website I have gone through all the learning materials <br>
      that were available on the university platform. The resources included several <br>
      links into tutorial websites that would be beneficial for designing.<br>
      I have made this website independently &amp; it took huge of time, effort &amp; patience. <br>
      I think designing is very creative and fun but time challenging as well.<br>
      I look forward to work with som website designing projects in the future. <br>
      I appreciate this chance <3
